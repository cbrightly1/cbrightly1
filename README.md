I am a recent graduate of the University of Pittsburgh and have made the great leap to Carnegie Mellon University as a graduate student in the Masters of Statistical Practice program. I have worked in the financial services field as an analytics and data science intern at First National Corporation for nearly two years, along with several independent consulting and research experiences. 

I am passionate about analytics and data science, with a strong belief that it's an art form of data engineering, statistical modeling, and business communication. My expertise centers on my ability to cultivate and engage in this entire process. The drive comes from my natural leadership skills, grit mentality, and strong curiosity. Then my technical skills, including SQL, Python, R, Tableau, Excel, and Power BI, allow me to contribute throughout the project.
